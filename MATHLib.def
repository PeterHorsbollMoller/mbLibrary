'In Euclid's world, if your starting point is O and the other endpoints
'of your two lines are points A and B, then determine the midpoint of the
'line AB, and call it C. The line you seek is OC.

'C can be found like so:
'Cx = (Ax + Bx) / 2
'Cy = (Ay + By) / 2

'Watch out for the end cases where C = O and A = B.
'-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
'Don't suppose either of you know, if I have the starting point and I
'have the slope of the line and I want to extend the line say 100m then
'how do I go about calculating the end point coords?

'Referring to the points named in my previous response, if L is the
'distance from O to C, and P is your new point, then:

'Lx (L+100m) = (Ox - Cx) / (Ox - Px)
'Ly (L+100m) = (Oy - Cy)  / (Oy - Py)
