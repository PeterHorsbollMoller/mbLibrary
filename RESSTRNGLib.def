'	07-08-2014 13:05:56		Added support for multiple language files
'						- RESSTRNGGetString(...) As String
'						- RESSTRNGLoadStrings(...) As Logical
'	30-04-2015 11:02:26		Added:
'						- RESSTRNGSetStringFilesFolder(...)
'						- RESSTRNGGetStringFilesFolder() As String
'	20-12-2019 08:54:56		Added
'						- RESSTRNGSetCharSet(...)
'						- RESSTRNGGetLanguage() As String
'						- RESSTRNGGetLanguageCode() As String
'						- RESSTRNGSetLanguageItem(...)
'						- RESSTRNGGetLanguageItem() As Integer
'						- RESSTRNGLoadStringsByCode(...) As Logical
'						- RESSTRNGGetStringFileCode(...) As String
'						- RESSTRNGGetStringFileItemByCode(...) As Integer
'						- RESSTRNGGetLanguageByItem(...) As String
'						- RESSTRNGGetLanguageCodeByItem(...) As String
'						- RESSTRNGGetLanguageCodes(...) As Integer
'						Changed
'						- RESSTRNGLoadStrings to use the CharSet, eg. "UTF-8" specified or System CharSet if non has been specified
'						- RESSTRNGLoadStringsINI now calls RESSTRNGLoadStrings
'						- String files should now also hold a two-letter language code if you want to use this, That's best practise for using UTF-8 encoded string files
'						- If no language has been specified, it will use SystemInfo(SYS_INFO_CULTURE) to detect the language of MapInfo Pro

'**The string file has this structure:
